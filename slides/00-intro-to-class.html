## Philosophy of the class

I and the TAs are here to **help you learn**. Ask questions.

We'll encourage **engagement**, **curiosity** and **generosity**
    
We favour **steady work** through the Term (vs. sleeping until finals) 

--

The  assessments attempt to reflect this ethos.

---

## More philosophy

When the term ends, I want

* You to be better at coding.
* You to have an understanding of the variety of methods available to do prediction and data analysis.
* You to articulate their strengths and weaknesses.
* You to be able to choose between different methods using __your intuition__ and __the data__.

--

I do not want

* You to be under undo stress
* You to feel the need to cheat, plagiarize, or drop the course
* You to feel treated unfairly.

--

I promise

* To grade/mark fairly. Good faith effort will be rewarded
* To be flexible. This semester (like the last 4) is different for everyone. 
* To understand and adapt to issues.

--

I do not promise that you will all get the grade you want.

# COVID considerations

---

## On COVID

.pull-left[
* I work on COVID a lot.
* Statistics is hugely important.


**Policies (TL; DR)**
* I encourage you to wear a mask
* Do .secondary[NOT] come to class if you are possibly sick
* Be kind and considerate to others
* The Marking scheme is flexible enough to allow some missed classes

## What is this course about?

![](gfx/ml-black-box.png)

???

- We'll talk about lots of ML models
- But our focus is on how to "understand" everything in this diagram.
- How do we interpret? Evaluate? Choose a model? 
- What are the implications / assumptions implied by our choices?
- Deep understanding of statistics helps with intuition.

---

## 6 modules


.pull-left[
1. Baby review

2. Model accuracy and selection

3. Regularization, smoothing, trees

4. Classifiers

5. Modern techniques (classification and regression)

6. Unsupervised learning
]

.pull-right[
* Each module is approximately 2 weeks long

* Each module is based on a collection of readings and lectures

* Each module (except the review) has a homework assignment 

]

---

## Assessments

Total across three components: 70 points, any way you want

1. .secondary[Labs], up to 20 points (2 each)

1. .secondary[Assignments], up to 60 points (15 each)

1. .secondary[Clickers], up to 10 points


Final Exam, 30 points


---

## Why this scheme?

- You stay on top of the material

- You come to class and participate

- You gain coding practice in the labs

- You work hard on the assignments

- Most of this is "Effort based": work hard, guarantee yourself 70%

--

Time expectations per week:  

* Coming to class: 3 hours  
* Reading the book: 1 hour  
* Labs: 1 hour  
* Homework: 4 hours  


---

## Labs / Assignments / Clickers

### The goal is to "Do the work"

.pull-left[


.secondary[Assignments]

* Not easy, especially the first 2, especially if you are unfamiliar with R / Rmarkdown / ggplot

* You may revise for 50% of missed points, see [Syllabus](https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-406/syllabus/)

* Don't leave these for the last minute

.secondary[Labs]

* Labs should give you practice, allow for questions with the TAs.

* They are due at 2300 on the day of your lab, lightly graded.

* You may do them at home, but this is not advised (better to work in the lab)


* Labs are lightly graded

]

.pull-right[

.secondary[Clickers]

* Questions are similar to the Final

* 0 points for skipping, 2 points for trying, 4 points for correct
    * Average of 3 = 10 points (the max)
    * Average of 2 = 5 points
    * Average of 1 = 0 points

.secondary[Average &lt; 1 drops your Final Mark 1 letter grade]

---

.pull-left[
### Final Exam

* Scheduled by the university.

* It is hard

* The median last year was 50%.

.secondary[Philosophy:]
&gt; If you put in the effort, you're guaranteed a B-, but to get an A+, you should really deeply understand the material.

No penalty for skipping the final. 

If you're cool with B- and hate tests, then that's fine.

.pull-right[
### Advice

* Skipping HW makes it hard to get to 70.

* Come to class!

* Yes it's at 8am. I hate it too.

* To compensate, I will record the class and post to Canvas.

* In terms of last year's class, attendence in lecture and active engagement (asking questions, coming to office hours, etc.) is the best predictor of success.

## Computer

]

.pull-right[
All coding in `R`

Suggest you use **RStudio** IDE

See &lt;https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-406/&gt; for instructions

It tells you how to install what you will need, hopefully all at once for the whole semester.

.emphasis[This course is not an 
intro to R / python / MongoDB / SQL.]

We will use R and we assume some background knowledge.

Links to useful supplementary resources are available on the website.

## Other resources


-   Canvas: Grades, links to videos from class

-   Course website: All the material (slides, extra worksheets) https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-406

-   Slack: Discussion board, questions.

- Github: Homework / Lab submission

--

&lt;hr&gt;

-  All lectures will be recorded and posted

- I cannot guarantee that they will all work properly (sometimes I mess it up)

---

## Some more words

* Lectures are hard. It's 8am, everyone's tired.

* I am also nervous to be around people. If you approach me, I may back up.

* Coding is hard. I hope you'll get better at it.

* "In-person"/ Hybrid/ Remote classes are hard. Living at home, in another country, with your siblings/kids/family is hard. 

* I strongly urge you to get up at the same time everyday. My plan is to go to the gym on M/W/F. It's really hard to sleep in until 10 on MWF and make class at 8 on T/Th.

--

&lt;hr&gt;

There's (still) a pandemic.

Let's be kind and understanding to each other. 

I have to give you a grade, but I want that grade to reflect your learning and effort, not other junk.

If you need help, please ask.
